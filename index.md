# Hi!

A warm welcome from Shubham Rao (@cshubhamrao) to my User Page on GithHub. I am a student presently in school from Bhopal, India. I am a wannabe programmer who is trying his best to learn programming concepts and programming languages.

## Languages I know:
- Java
- C#
- Go
- Python
- C
- C++
- Assembly 

When I am not learning, you can find me looking for the latest tech news or diving deep inside, hacking or trying cool stuffs on my Ubuntu and/or Windows installation. I am a fan of the FOSS community and love Free Software.

## My projects:
- [**Handshake**](https://github.com/SecureHandshake/HandshakeApp) Peer-to-peer file transfer. No password/sign-up/storage/server required.

I am learning new technologies and programming languages so see more projects come up in coming days â˜º.
